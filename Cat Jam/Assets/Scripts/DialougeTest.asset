  - Hello cat! This ship is going to crash soon and only you can save it! Quick,
    grab that keycard and leave the room!
  - Cat! I need your help, this space ship is going to crash if you don't.
  - The humans can't see me and they'll stop you if you're seen.
  - You need to put a heavy object on the big red button in the control room.
  - 'Press WASD to move and enter to pick things up. '
  - We're all counting on you!
  - Yay! You saved the ship
  - You've been caught :(
